Key fields: pizza_id, order_id, pizza_name_id, quantity, order_date, order_time, unit_price, total_price, pizza_size, pizza_category, pizza_name, and ingredients.

Data was cleaned and structured in SQL Server before being loaded into Power BI for visualization



### 5.	Highlights

‚Ä¢	Business Problem

Pizza restaurants accumulate vast amounts of transactional data, yet often lack effective tools to transform this information into actionable business insights. Key questions such as:

Which products generate the highest revenue? Identifying top-performing menu items is essential for optimizing offerings and maximizing profitability.

What are the busiest times and days for sales? Understanding peak periods helps with efficient staff scheduling, inventory planning, and targeted promotions.

Which pizza sizes and categories are most popular among customers? Analyzing preferences by size and type enables better menu design and marketing strategies.

These key questions are difficult to address using raw, unstructured data alone, highlighting the need for a comprehensive dashboard that delivers clear, data-driven insights

‚Ä¢	Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive, visual tool that:

Enables users to explore pizza sales data in depth.

Supports decisions on menu optimization, marketing, and inventory.

Uncovers trends in sales, product performance, and customer behavior
