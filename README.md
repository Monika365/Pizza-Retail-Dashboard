# Pizza_Retail_Dashboard
 The goal of this project is to create an annual sales report for a pizza store using sales data from 2015, helping the owner understand customer behavior and sales trends to inform business decisions and future growth strategies
 
### 1.	🍕 Pizza Sales Analytics: Power BI Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive data visualisation dashboard designed to analyse and monitor pizza sales performance using SQL and Power BI—focusing on sales trends, product breakdowns, and actionable business insights.
### 2.	 Purpose
The Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard is a visually engaging Power BI report that empowers users to explore, analyze, and compare pizza sales data from a full year of transactions. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as revenue, order trends, product performance, and customer preferences, enabling restaurant managers, analysts, and business owners to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies

### 3.	Tech Stack
List the key technologies used to build the dashboard.

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform for creating interactive reports and dashboards.

📂 Power Query – Used for data transformation, cleaning, and shaping before analysis in Power BI.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures, KPIs, and dynamic visuals.

📝 SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – For initial data import, cleaning, and KPI calculation.

🔗 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (sales, products, orders) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.

📁 File Format – .pbix for the Power BI dashboard, .csv for raw data, and .sql for query documentation

### 4.	Data Source

Key fields: pizza_id, order_id, pizza_name_id, quantity, order_date, order_time, unit_price, total_price, pizza_size, pizza_category, pizza_name, and ingredients.

Data was cleaned and structured in SQL Server before being loaded into Power BI for visualization



### 5.	Highlights

•	Business Problem

Pizza restaurants accumulate vast amounts of transactional data, yet often lack effective tools to transform this information into actionable business insights. Key questions such as:

Which products generate the highest revenue? Identifying top-performing menu items is essential for optimizing offerings and maximizing profitability.

What are the busiest times and days for sales? Understanding peak periods helps with efficient staff scheduling, inventory planning, and targeted promotions.

Which pizza sizes and categories are most popular among customers? Analyzing preferences by size and type enables better menu design and marketing strategies.

These key questions are difficult to address using raw, unstructured data alone, highlighting the need for a comprehensive dashboard that delivers clear, data-driven insights
